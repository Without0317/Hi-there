        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            I’m Khen Patra, also known as Without0317 in the music scene. I’m a high school senior from Indonesia, but my influences are more aligned with trends from English-speaking countries than local ones. Although I’m a laid-back person, my sharp resting face sometimes makes people think I’m cold or judgmental, but I’m always willing to help—just ask nicely.
            <br>
            <br>
            Right now, I’m focused on creating music videos for my own songs while also coding and building my personal website. I have a passion for both technology and music, and I plan to pursue Computer Science in college. My skills include programming, designing, animating, playing and creating music. While I’m typically the one ensuring everything runs smoothly, I can get overly analytical when something sparks my interest.
            <br>
            <br>
            I live by the principle that "everything must be able to be explained," and I strive to master everything I set out to do. Whether it’s coding, music, or art, I’m always aiming for excellence.
            <br>
            <br>
            While I don’t have a long list of achievements, I’ve always been a top student during my early school years, placing first and second in exams. I’ve also made it to the city level of a science Olympiad in informatics and even landed 5th place in a city-wide blogging competition.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the future, I aim to be a full-stack developer, seamlessly combining my love for coding with my creative passions in music, video production, and art.
