        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Khen Patra A.K.A Without0317, a humble student from Indonesia. I don't really has much of an achievement since a competition is quite rare at my hometown but here it is, I manage to get position 5th in a city wide blogging competition when I'm in middle school but yeah it's not that great, well in highschool I did manage to get 2nd place city wide tho.
            <br>
            <br>
            As for academic side, yeah I was one of that prodigy kid. I got 6 years of streak getting first place in primary school + 1 year of middle school, and then covid come. but when and after that nothing good come from my academic cuz I start to focus on what I want to do. 
            <br>
            <br>
And so You might ask me what's your interest, we'll tbh it was quite a mess, here's an example, I could play a piano but yeah it's not really that good so I start learning creating digital music through DAW but as you can hear in the background it's not that good either, so I started to do illustration and no I still suck at it (not gonna go into detail as it was horrendous), and I realize my analytical capability isn't that bad.... but yeah as you can guess it's not that good to rival other, so I start to get into programming, and no I hasn't finish any apps/games, and here I am using what's left in my nearly destroyed soul writing this excruciatingly humiliating paragraph you just read. Well that's it for my interest. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I live by the principle that "everything must be able to be explained," and I strive to master everything I set out to do. Whether it’s coding, music, or art, I’m always aiming for excellence.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the future, I aim to be a full-stack developer, seamlessly combining my love for coding with my creative passions in music, video production, and art.
